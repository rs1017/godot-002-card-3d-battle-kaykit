## 1. Reference Summary
- Source pack refreshed under docs/ralph/reference/minion-masters.
- Core benchmark: fast readability, short combat loop, clear ownership cues.

## 2. Feature Planning
1. Define one concrete gameplay/UI change for this cycle.
2. Implement in scene/script pair with typed GDScript and stable paths.
3. Record manual reproduction steps and expected result.

## 3. Graphic Production Rule
- ComfyUI: generate missing card art with tools/generate_card_art.py.
- KayKit: prefer existing licensed assets under assets/kaykit/.

## 4. Development / Review / QA
1. Development: implement the scoped change.
2. Review: verify logic regressions and scene/script references.
3. QA: run static QA and headless startup check, then manual smoke test.
