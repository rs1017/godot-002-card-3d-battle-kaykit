## Ralph Workflow Skill Adoption
1. Weekly pattern extraction from 5 community posts on balance / onboarding / UX.
2. Convert pattern to in-project checklist item (rules, combat formula, card economy).
3. Attach evidence links in each cycle run report.
4. Reject cycle if no new actionable planning insight is recorded.

## Immediate Practice Tasks
- Analyze map readability examples and bridge-control pressure loops.
- Define card inventory UX principles from community references.
- Refine victory/defeat animation readability and pacing goals.
- Build combat formula variants and compare with QA findings.
